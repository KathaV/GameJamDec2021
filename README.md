# Explanation of the game
**TODO**


# User Interface
**TODO**



# Modelling Objects and Entities
**TODO**
Will be drawn by Sonia
## Chef
* Currently, not visible. Its states are modelled by colour change such that:
    * **Green** - not looking for player/looking away
    * **Yellow** - turning towards/away from player. Potentially, can be a vulnerable stage which player movement can attract looking?
    * **Red** - Danger/Looking. If player is found like this, gameover or whatever

# Mechanics/Physics of Objects and Entities

## Player
Potato which user can control.
**Requirements**:
* Must be tagged `Player`
* Must include Movement and Hideable Scripts
* Must include RigidBody and 2D Collider

## Hideable Objects
Objects which player can hide behind when Chef is looking and avoid detection.
**Requirements**:
* 2D Collider attached, IsTrigger enabled. Collider should be resized to smaller than actual size, such that a player must be well behind the object before the collider space is triggered.
* Must be tagged `HidingPlace`
* Player requirements satisfied


# Movement and Camera
As developed by Cindy:

## Camera Motion
Camera motion in this game is implemented as a third person view where the camera follows the player. The player does not need to control the camera. Hence, there would not be any pressure on the player to move the camera and character at the same time.

## Movement control : 
* Standard WASD keys are used to control movements W-Forward , A-Left, S-Backward (Towards camera), D-Right
* Space bar is used for jumping motion. Double jump can be achieved by double clicking space bar.
These movements control was chosen as they are commonly used for similar control in games.
