**Player**
- Player need to be tagged
- Player and platform need to have box colliders 2D
- Player needs to have rigidbody2D

**Camera**
- Main camera
    * Add cinemachine brain
- LevelBorder (Transparent square/polygon)
    * Add polygon collider as a component to the background
    * Tick `isTrigger` under polygon collider
- Cinemachine 2D should be added in the Scene
    * Assign Player to Cinemachine2D under 'Follow'
    * Add extension Confine2D in Cinemachine2D
    * Add the polygon (background) collider in Confine2D
Note: Sometimes might look a bit janky due to Confine2D.
Solution:
    = Adjust ortho lens size in 2D camera
    = Adjust jumpSpeed to avoid player jumping above half the background

**Parallax Effect (Optional)**
- Works best with multiplier < 1
